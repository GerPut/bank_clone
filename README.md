Bank Clone 

This is my largest project that includes 3 mini projects. I am continuously working on this project to perfect it. I had a look at other bank landing pages and their content and came up with my own that looks similar. The site is responsive to all screen sizes. The site is devided up into sections. The links in the navbar takes the user to the different sections of the page and is styled so that when the user scrolls down the page the navbar will change color.

The three mini projects I include are: 
#1 Random RSA number generator. The user pushes a button to generate a random code/number that can be copied. A small pop-up message will get displayed once the user succesfully copied their number. All of this was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
#2 Loan Calcualtor. An basic form app where the user's input is taken and a calculation is made to display a monthly repayment. Javascript function was used.
#3 Currency exchange. I small app was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Using fetch API

Also in this project is a login form where the user put in basic details such as email and password (123). The password will get checked if it is the correct on and the user will be taken to their personal account page.
The project took 3 weeks to complete and is still being worked on to make it better.
