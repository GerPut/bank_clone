## Bank Site Project 

This is my largest project that includes 3 mini projects. I am continuously working on this project to perfecting it and fix bugs. I had a look at other bank landing pages and their content and came up with my own that looks similar. The site is responsive to all screen sizes. The site is devided up into sections. The links in the navbar takes the user to the different sections of the page. The navbar is styled in a way that changes its color when the user scrolls down the page.

The three mini projects include are: 

#1 Random RSA number generator. The user pushes a button to generate a random code/number with letters that can be copied. A small pop-up message will get displayed once the user succesfully copied their number. All of this was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
#2 Loan Calculator. A basic form app where the user's input is taken and a calculation is made to display a monthly repayment. Javascript function was used to calculate values after a user's input.
#3 Currency exchange. This small app was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Using fetch API from another currency exchange site the app calculates a current exchange rate between two differrent countries currencies. The user can choose form a variety of currencies and also has the option to swap the currencies around.

Also in this project is a login form where the user put in basic details such as email and password (123). The password will get checked if it is the correct on and the user will be taken to their personal account page.
The project took three weeks to put together and is still being worked on to make it better.
